# Thanks

We would like to thank the developers of these libraries:

- [hv-2.0rc2/hv.h for calculating hyper-volumes](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1688440): we adapted this implementation as a reference for our hypervolume algorithm
- [Boost.Geometry package](https://github.com/boostorg/geometry): we use Boost.Geometry for our benchmarks
- [Spatial C++ Library](http://spatial.sourceforge.net): our second reference besides Boost.Geometry
