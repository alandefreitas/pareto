# Use cases

Some use cases are to store objects with their best values according to the following trade-offs:

* Machine Learning: Model accuracy vs. model complexity
* Approximation algorithms: error vs. time
* Product design: investment vs. profit vs. safety 
* P2P networks: latency vs. trust 
* Robust optimization: quality vs. sensitivity / robustness  
* Design: Mean quality vs. standard deviation
* Systems control: Performance vs. price vs. quality
* Portfolio optimization: expected return vs. risk
