# Design goals

- Intuitive syntax: interface like any other native data structure.
- Lots of indicators: calculate statistics with one line of code. 
- Easy integration: C++ and Python interfaces.
- Performance: spatial indexes. No pairwise comparisons on linear lists (unless you want to).
- Efficient memory allocation to make small fronts competitive with linear lists.
- Stability: lots of unit tests, benchmarks, and continuous integration.
