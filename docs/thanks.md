# Thanks

We would like to thank the developers of these libraries:

- [Boost.Geometry package](https://github.com/boostorg/geometry): we use Boost.Geometry for our benchmarks
- [Trase library](https://github.com/trase-cpp/trase): we used this library to generate the plots for the first version of this library
- [hv-2.0rc2/hv.h for calculating hyper-volumes](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1688440): we use this implementation to calculate exact hypervolumes in high dimensions.
