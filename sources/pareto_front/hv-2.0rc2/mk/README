Adding new compilers
------------------------

If you want or need to add a new compiler / architecture combination
to the build system you will need to create a file named

  $(uname -s)_$(uname -m)_<compiler>.mk

At a minimum it needs to set the OPT_CFLAGS and ARCH variables. If all
you want to do is use GCC on a new platform you can usually simple
include gcc.mk. In general this should only be necessary if you are
cross-compiling or want to add additional flags after the general gcc
detection logic.

If your compiler is unknown, the build system will attempt to auto
detect if it is a gcc variant and then use mk/gcc.mk.

If you have new platform or compiler support files, please submit them
to manuel.lopez-ibanezulb.ac.be.
